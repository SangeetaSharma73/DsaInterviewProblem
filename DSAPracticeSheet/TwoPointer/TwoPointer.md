# Two Pointer


## 1. same direction pointer
## 2. opposite direction pointer


## Scenerio
- sorted array sometimes but not always



3. Move all zeros to the end while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements
Problem Statement:
Given an array, move all zeroes to the end while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements.

Example:
Input:




arr = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
Output:




[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
4. Remove duplicates from a sorted array in-place
Problem Statement:
Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length.

Example:
Input:




arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
Output:




[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  (modified in-place)
5. Reverse a given array using two pointers
Problem Statement:
Given an array, reverse the elements using the two-pointer approach.

Example:
Input:




arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output:




[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
