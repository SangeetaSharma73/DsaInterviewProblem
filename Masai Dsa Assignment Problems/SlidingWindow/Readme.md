# Sliding window :
- sliding window is a technique which is used to solve the complex problem and it optimize the time and space complexity of a program . It sliding on the arr or any other data structure like a window so that' algorithm is known as sliding window.


## Types :
1. Fixed Size Window : We have a already given the size of a particular slide or window.
2. Variable Size Window : Which don't have any kind of window size . It could be shrink or expand according to the condition.

### Fixed size window

1. Question 
- we have to find the maximum sum of k size in the array.

### Steps:
