# Description
# Given an array A of size n of positive and negative integers, find a subarray (containing at least one number) with the maximum product.
# Input
# The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤10) - the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
# The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000).
# The second line of the test case contains n integers (-100 ≤ Ai ≤ 100).
# Output
# For each test case, print the answer: The maximum product possible.
# Sample Input 1
# 2
# 3
# -3 0 -2
# 4
# 4 5 -1 2
# Sample Output 1
# 0
# 20
